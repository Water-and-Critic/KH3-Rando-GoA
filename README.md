# Description

With much inspiration from the KH2 GoA Randomizer, the KH3 GoA Randomizer starts off with Sora within the Garden of Assemblage where each of the portals gives access to a specific world found in the game. The main objective is to travel through all of the worlds opening chests in order to get better items and abilities all while looking for three proofs in order to open the portal to the final boss within the game. You may be thinking "Three proofs?! KH3 only has two!" well this mod introduces a brand new proof The Proof of Fantasies (but lets be for real, this should've actually been the reward for defeating Yozora). The file found here on Nexus Mods will give you the main chunk you need that being the GoA aspect of the mod. In order to get the randomization functionality you will have to go to the KH Randomizer Website (link found above) where you get to pick and choose from tons of options what gets randomizer and what doesn't (more information on this can be found on the website itself). Again, installation of this mod will get rid of all of your save data due to changing some core datatables that game looks at which then deems all of the pervious save data as corrupted. So make sure to make backups if you don't want to lose any important saves!


This mod is also 100% open source if you'd like to take a look at what is going on under the hood! There will be tons of documentation coming shortly and it can be found on git hub (link found above).


If there are any issues or questions you have there is also the KH3 Randomizer Discord server you can join (link found above)
